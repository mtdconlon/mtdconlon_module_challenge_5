**User Story**
- AS A front-end web developer.
- I WANT to apply JavaScript programming to a web application.
- SO THAT I can generate a secure random password.

**Acceptance Criteria** 
Your application must:

- Generate a password when the button is clicked.
- Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

- Length of password:
    - At least 10 characters but no more than 64.

- Character types:
    - Lowercase
    - Uppercase
    - Numeric
    - Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
